# Build-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-pipelines

## Project Overview

The project aims to showcase the process of constructing and evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generation pipelines. The provided notebook (`llm_evaluation_ragas.ipynb`) demonstrates the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using the RAGAS framework, utilizing OpenAI's Wiki page as a dataset.

## Files

- **Python Notebook**: `llm_evaluation_ragas.ipynb`
  - Jupyter notebook providing a step-by-step guide on building and evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generation pipelines using the RAGAS framework.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Build-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-pipelines.git
   cd Build-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-pipelines
   ```

2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook llm_evaluation_ragas.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to understand and implement Retrieval Augmented Generation pipelines using RAGAS.
